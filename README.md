# Engeto_project_2
The Game Bulls & Cows as the first project for the Engeto academy.
The game Bulls and Cows generates a secret random four-digit number. It repeatedly prompts the user to input a four-digit number, displaying after each guess how many numbers were correctly guessed and correctly positioned (bulls) and how many numbers were correctly guessed but incorrectly positioned (cows). After guessing the entire number, it calculates the total guessing time and the number of attempts.
In the version "Bulls&Cows_with_statistics", the program saves the guessing time and the number of attempts to the attached file statistiky.txt and calculates the average guessing time and the average number of attempts, taking into account all previous rounds played.
